## Installing for local development 

Follow the steps to clone the repo for you to make changes to this project.

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vyperlang/gaboon
cd gaboon
```

2. Sync dependencies

*This repo uses rye to manage python dependencies and version. So you don't have to deal with virtual environments (much)*

```bash
rye sync
```

*Note: When you delete your terminal/shell, you will need to reactivate this virtual environment again each time. To exit this python virtual environment, type `deactivate`*

3. Create a new branch

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

And start making your changes! Once you're done, you can commit your changes and push them to your forked repo.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'your commit message'
git push <your_forked_github>
```

## Running Tests

Run the following:

```bash
rye test
```
This is equivalent to running `pytest` in the root directory of the project.

# Code Style Guide
